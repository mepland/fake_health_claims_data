## Cloning the Repository
ssh

git clone git@github.com:mepland/fake_health_claims_data.git
```

git clone https://github.com/mepland/fake_health_claims_data.git
```

## Installing Dependencies
It is recommended to work in a [python virtual environment](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/) to avoid clashes with other installed software. If you do not wish to use a virtual environment you can usually just run the first few cells of the notebook in question - useful when running on cloud-based virtual machines.
```bash
python -m venv ~/.venvs/fake_health_claims_data
source ~/.venvs/fake_health_claims_data/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running Notebooks

```bash
jupyter lab fake_service_lines.ipynb
```

# Reading Outputs into Pandas from URL
```python
